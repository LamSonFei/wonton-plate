# Web application starter kit only using Web Components v1

This is a base project with multiple objectives:
 * Practicing 'Native' Web Development from scratch.
 * Understanding the life cycle of Web Components and their usage/limitations/potential.
 * Avoiding the use of external libraries / frameworks to keep things lightweight
 * Building a full application template along with a CLI (coming later).

 To start a development server:
 ```
 npm run dev-server
 ```
 To build the demo:
 ```
 npm run build
 ```
To launch the built application:
 ```
 npm start
 ```

This project is automatically built using [Circle CI](https://circleci.com).<br />
A demo is also available, thanks to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), at https://wonton-plate.herokuapp.com.
